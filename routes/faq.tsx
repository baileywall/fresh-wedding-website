        Where do we stay and when should we book?

      <p class="text-center px-8 lg:px-64">
        Hang tight, we'll tell you when to book! The venue has space for most
        guests to stay onsite in cabins (with private rooms) or in yurts. We
        will send out a survey along with our invitation in Spring 2025 to gauge
        interest, and for those who want to stay onsite, we will assign groups
        to cabins/yurts so we can maximize the number of people onsite.

        What will we do all weekend?
      </p>
      <p class="text-center px-8 lg:px-64">
        Our camp weekend will have something for everyone! Enjoy some {"R&R"} in
        your cabin hot tub or at the riverside, hop in a canoe or kayak, or take
        a walk on one of the nearby trails to enjoy the scenery. We'll also have
        lots of games set up for some friendly competition if anyone wants to
        challenge Colton in spikeball (you don't).
      </p>
      <p class="text-center px-8 lg:px-64">
        Nights will probably include cards, board games, music, and campfire
        time. Your camp counselors (us) will provide a full itinerary, but
        you're always welcome to choose your own adventure!
      </p>
      <p class="text-center px-8 lg:px-64">
        The daily agenda is TBD, but we recommend arriving on Thursday evening
        (3pm check-in) or Friday morning to make the most of the weekend! On
        Friday evening we'll have a time for toasts (and roasts?) after dinner,
        and on Saturday afternoon we'll have a wedding ceremony followed by a
        reception. Sunday includes a farewell breakfast before checkout at 11am.
      </p>
      <p class="text-4xl text-center px-8 lg:px-64">What should I bring?</p>
      <p class="text-center px-8 lg:px-64 mb-12">
        Your camp counselors will provide a packing list around the time
        invitations arrive in Spring 2025. For now, you can count on bringing
        some good walking shoes, a swimsuit, and something nice to wear on
        Saturday that falls under “campfire cocktail attire.” We're still
        workshopping that dress code.
